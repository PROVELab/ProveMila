the config file for me was located at: config file located at: /home/torrey/esp/esp-idf/components/freertos/config/include/freertos

config parameters to change:
//ensure only allocating tasks statically, which should already be the case if we only use xTaskCreateStatic:
#define configSUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION 1
#define configSUPPORT_DYNAMIC_ALLOCATION 0 

//tasks won't be interrupted until they enter blocking state
#define  configUSE_PREEMPTION 0

//tasks shouldn't be slicing if preemption is off (i think?), but lets avoid anything of this sort :) bc we shouldn't be needing it
#define configUSE_TIME_SLICING 0
